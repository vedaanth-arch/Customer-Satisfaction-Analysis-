4. **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
   - Segment customers into Promoters, Passives, and Detractors.

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Bar Plot: Gender-wise Average Satisfaction
- Box Plot: Age Group vs Satisfaction
- Heatmap: Feature Correlation
- Scatter Plots: Ratings vs Overall Satisfaction
- Line Plot: Purchase Frequency vs Average Rating (with labels)
- Bar Plot: Loyalty Program Impact
